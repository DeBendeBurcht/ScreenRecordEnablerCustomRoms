#### WARNING I DONT KNOW WHAT IM DOING BUT IM BRAVE
#### EXPERIMENTAL AS OF NOW< TRYING TO IMPLEMENT A SOLUZTION AS WRITTEN BELOW.

## Description 
This modules is specifically designed for my Lenovo tb-x606f running the last release of pixel experience 13 and twrp 3.7FA
It replaces the media_profiles.xml located at /system/etc/ to prevent an error that prevents me from screen recording. This results in decreased quality, which is perfect for me as i only use the screen record data to send to my server to run full house wireless ambilight right from my tablet.
This module should fix (or prevet) issues with screen recording by limiting resolution to 720p. 


## Changelog
v1.1 - Added the 720p limited profiles in media_profiles.xml.

v1 - Initial Fork.
