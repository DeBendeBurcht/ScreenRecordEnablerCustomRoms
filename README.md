#### I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M DOING BUT I'M BRAVE!
### EXPERIMENTAL AS OF NOW. TRYING TO IMPLEMENT A SOLUTION AS WRITTEN BELOW.

## Description
This module is specifically designed for my Lenovo TB-X606F running the latest release of Pixel Experience 13 and TWRP 3.7FA. It replaces the media_profiles.xml located at /system/etc/ to prevent an error that prevents me from screen recording.

The module reduces the recording quality to 720p, which is perfect for my use case, as I only need the screen recording data to send to my server for running a full-house wireless ambilight right from my tablet. This module should fix (or prevent) issues with screen recording by limiting the resolution to 720p.

## Changelog

v1.1 - Added the 720p limited profiles in media_profiles.xml.

v1 - Initial Fork.

## Usage Instructions

Installation: Install the module via Magisk Manager.

Reboot: Reboot your device after installation.

Testing: Test the screen recording to confirm that it works as expected.

## Disclaimer
- This module is experimental; use at your own risk.
- Always back up your device before making modifications.
